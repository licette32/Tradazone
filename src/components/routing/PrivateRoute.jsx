/**
 * PrivateRoute
 *
 * Part of the ADR-002 routing model (docs/adr/002-app-routing-stack.md, Issue #202).
 *
 * Guards protected routes by checking BOTH the in-memory React auth state
 * AND the live localStorage session on every render.
 *
 * Three outcomes:
 *  1. Authenticated + live session valid → render children.
 *  2. Authenticated in memory BUT session expired in storage → redirect to
 *     /signin?reason=expired&redirect=<path> and call logout() to purge
 *     in-memory state.
 *  3. Not authenticated at all → redirect to /signin?redirect=<path>.
 *
 * Checking loadSession() directly (not just user.isAuthenticated) is critical:
 * the React state is set once at mount and stays truthy for the entire page
 * session, even after the localStorage TTL has passed.
 *
 * ISSUE: App Routing — Mock API data needs broader edge-case coverage
 * Category: Testing / App Routing
 * Affected Area: App Routing (PrivateRoute + App.jsx route table)
 * Description: The following edge cases were previously untested:
 *   - Deep-link redirect param is preserved when an unauthenticated user
 *     navigates directly to a protected path (e.g. /customers).
 *   - Expired-session redirect carries reason=expired for mid-session TTL
 *     expiry (session valid at mount, TTL passes while app is running).
 *   - Catch-all route (path="*") redirects unknown paths to /signin.
 *   - Public routes (/pay/:checkoutId, /invoice/:id) are reachable without auth.
 * Fix: expiredPath latched in state so reason=expired survives the logout()
 *   re-render. Tests added in src/test/PrivateRoute.test.jsx.
